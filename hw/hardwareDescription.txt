The current plan is to use Arduino bords and an RF transciever to communicte. 

We have yet to determine how to power the units. Batteries have been looked at (motorcycle batteries might be good),
and wired power has been considered.

Other options explored:
WiFi (XBee?) - too expensive at $25 per XBee
Bluetooth - Not looked into very much
CAN Bus - No in out = no chain. Could develop own bord and connector, but expensive.

Possible expansion with self testing e-match points would be really cool.
